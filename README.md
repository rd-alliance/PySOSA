# sUAS data Working Group

This is a repository for community work on developing best practices for sUAS (aka Drones/RPAS/UAV/...) as regards manageing data.  The key foci for this project were proposed during the Research Data Alliance's 14th Plenary in Helsinki.  All topics gatherd are available [here](./GroupInitialisation/P14Session.md).

**Note this WG is not yet endorsed:** Charter still under development, this is not yet an endorsed group, draft charter is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WXppdfJ5SGojf-0BcxjXtaEu8bh3hfCoQNIi54v6xyI/edit), input and comments are most welcome.

## Contributing
* As of 11 November 2019 we are seeking input and help in writing the charter [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WXppdfJ5SGojf-0BcxjXtaEu8bh3hfCoQNIi54v6xyI/edit)
    * Once submitted and endorsed this page will be updated
* Issue submissions to this repo are more than welcome, this effort will only be of value with community input!
* **Mailinglist:** This group is being spun up out of the RDA [sUAS Data Interest Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/small-unmanned-aircraft-systems%E2%80%99-data-ig) which hosts our mailing list.  Please join (for free) this list to stay up to date on all activities.  If you are new to the RDA and the sUAS data IG, the introductory presentation given at the P14 session might be a useful starting point [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VzNgMK0RIYXyVwDYZ3mzKpOoGSm9EBk_pcI5T2hZxk4/edit)
    * All past activities of the IG can be found in the common [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kcWdTjkZfpL7aypxShhAklS08Ig8UezY)
* **Slack Channel:**  This working group is being supported by the Sloan Foundation funded LANDRS project.  This is a broader project that aims to build foundational infrstructure to support the development of sUAS data infrastructure through the provision of APIs and ontologies.  Community input is welcome on this too via this github repo [LANDRS Toolkit](https://github.com/landrs-toolkit), please find ongoing activities here and join [this slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/landrsworkspace/shared_invite/enQtODI5MjkwMzQ4NTY0LTE3MzQ4YmVmMzRlYzY4N2ViOTBmNGJlOTVhYjc2OTllYzZkOTFkNTU4OGYwN2E0ODFhYzJmOTYzNmRkY2MzODQ).
