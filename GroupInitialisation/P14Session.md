# WG foci collection via unconference

At the RDA's [14th plenary](https://www.rd-alliance.org/plenaries/rdas-14th-plenary-helsinki-finland) in Helsinki (23-25 October 2019) the sUAS Data IG session was run as a mini-unconference so as to gauge the group's interest in forming a WG and what topics should be covered.  The following is an account of all the topics proposed and the votes each recieved.

The session notes are also available in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tWWIcleALPswtUa2zxPWCsQ2WNlwbGse9DZwL_LUYtE/edit#heading=h.7bguaxabrnxc).

## Topics proposed along with their votes:
Unconference mechanics used:
- Everyone was given 5min to propose topics to postits
- Everyone was told to vote for 3 topics and 1 extra for the "Drone Applications" grouping

In an attempt to identify foci topics have been grouped according to theme although there are clearly instances where a topic could be placed in multiple groups.  Topics were grouped slightly differently before we voted due to time constraints and rushing.  Regrouping has been done to identify correctly dominant themes and topics per votes.
